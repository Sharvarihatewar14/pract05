<p align="center">
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni (commonly known as M. S. Dhoni) is an Indian cricketer who captained 
the Indian team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. 
An attacking right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of 
the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut in 
December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.
